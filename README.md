This is a directory to organise my work on spiking neurons.
The goal is to make a cohesive layout of my work, and the modules I build to support it.

The structure is currently as follows:
Spikes
├── .venv
├── spikes                          # an expanding set of subpackages & modules
│   ├── init.py                     
│   ├── main.py                     # to execute code
│   ├── data                        # for simulation data
│   │   └── <tobefilled>
│   └── tests                       # to keep code working
│       └── tests.py
├── docs                            # to document the functionality of the package
│   └── example.rst
├── README.md
